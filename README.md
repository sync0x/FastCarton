# FastCarton
Individual utilities for creating different kinds of folding paper card instruments.

This is a counterpart to CardCarton in that while the other is an all-in-one tool for creation of many commonly known kinds of folding card instrument, this repository is a collection of tools that could either be used in a chain, or individually, depending on the specific needs of a specialty product.

While some if not all of the tools in this repository were created for use with commercial illustration and design products, as I developed these in my own time and on my own equipment and resources I have the luxury of making these generally available under LGPL.

There will be extensions to these which I may provide for limited distribution to my clients under a commercial arrangement. I will not advertise these here. Any testing and development data collected the moment experiments are performed on their own equipment will be their intellectial property. You can remain assured it is in my interest for my clients to know exactly how to deal with and extend what I have provided; thus, LGPL use in a commercial setting is acceptable. It would be their choice as to wether the unobscured source code of those extensions can be distributed or are not to be published at all.
